# XteXt
This is a text editor made in python. I wanted to name it Xtext with the X standing for extreme but thats already a thing so I capitalized both X's. Very minimal and lightweight. Also it technically isn't a text editor because you can only create text files and not edit them. Also it has a logo of a dragon which I stole from cooltext.com but it only displays sometimes because I can't be bothered to make multiple sizes of it
